<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Nothing can be as refreshing as the watermelon juice after a long timresome day. Here's the perfect recipe for an absolutely refreshing watermelon juice! </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 small sweet watermelon (a 6 pounder will do)</li>
    <li>1 small lime, juiced </li>
    
    
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    
<li>Slice the watermelon in half. Using a big spoon, scoop chunks of sweet watermelon into the blender. Discard the rind.</li>
<li>Blend the watermelon until it is totally pulverized. This shouldn't take more than a minute. For extra flavor, squeeze the juice of one small lime into the blender and blend for a few seconds.</li>
<li>If your watermelon is notably pulpy or seeded, pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher. If not, you can pour it directly into glasses filled with ice. Watermelon juice will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days. The juice will separate over time; stir it with a spoon to recombine.</li>

</ol>
